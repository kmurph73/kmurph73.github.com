Like many, I struggle with digital distractions.  Opening the browser and typing 're'(ddit) is burned into my fingertips.  Before I know it, an hour has passed and I'm feeling horribly guilty.

In the past, I've used the [StayFocusd][1] chrome extension, which, while a massive improvement over nothing, was still too easy to circumvent by switching browsers, going incognito, or switching Chrome users.

Enter the [hosts][2] file, which on OS X & Linux can be found in /etc/hosts.  It allows you to map domains to an ip address, which can be effectively utilized to block distracting sites.

`127.0.0.1 www.reddit.com`  will map Reddit to your local machine's address, i.e. nowhere.

The problem is that it can be a bit of a pain to type `sudo mvim /etc/hosts` then (un)comment out the sites, and save & quit.

I was initially hesitant to write a script to automate this, since it would be just as easy to unblock sites as it was to block ... then I realized the script didn't
need to unblock anything!  So I wrote a [simple script][3] that uncomments all of the sites in my /etc/hosts file (thus blocking them) and put it in my path.  If I want to unblock
them, I have to manually edit /etc/hosts.  But reblocking them is a simple `sudo block` away.
