ive done a lot of web dev and a bit of iOS/Android dev, here are my opinions on their strength/weaknesses in comparison to eachother

* android/ios have built in components that work on mobile and are super nice.  however, customizing these components can be painful.  in turn, web gives you virtually
nothing out of the box, but you can easily create your own components, or customize existing 3rd party components.

* chrome dev tools are a complete game changer.  being able to fiddle with css/js and see their effects *instantly* is something ios/android have little answer to.
sure, ios has interface builder and android has the view preview tool, but they still fall short of chrome's dev tools by far.

* android/ios dev is very amenable to IDEs and tooling.  however, their IDEs are often slow (especially Android) and janky.  with web, I can easily use Vim, which is
fast snappy and powerful, but doesnt have the powerful code completion, static analysis, debugging etc stuff that IDEs provide.
