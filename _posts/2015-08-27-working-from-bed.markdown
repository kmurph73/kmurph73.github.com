I've found my mental energy is at its greatest when I'm laying down.  There are quite a few positions I alternate between, and I'm always looking for new ones :)

There are two key tools in my arsenal that make this practical:

## Bedrest

Self-explanatory

<div style='clear:both'></div>

## Laptop desk

My aunt gave me a bamboo laptop desk awhile back, and I've used it just about everyday since.  I couldn't find the desk I have online, but this is kinda close.  Good used in bed, on the couch, or in a reclining chair.  Next time I travel, I'll probably bring something like [this](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1689432703/lapdeck-the-10-recyclable-laptop-desk) along.

When not using the laptop desk, I'll alternate between laying on my left and right side, my laptop resting on a pillow.

Another nice position is laying on your belly, pillow tucked under your chin, and laptop in front of you.  Unfortunately this seems to encourage forehead wrinkles,
and it becomes uncomfortable more quickly than the other positions, so I use it sparingly, but it's a nice counter to the hunched over style of the other positions.
