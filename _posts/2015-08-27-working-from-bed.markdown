I've found the laying position to be best for my mental energy, probably due to better blood flow.  I'm always looking for new positions to work from.

There are a few tools in my arsenal that I use to help facilitate this.

## Bedrest

Self-explanatory

## Laptop desk

My aunt gave me a bamboo laptop desk awhile back, and I've used it just about everyday since.  I couldn't find the desk I have online, but this is kinda close.  Good used in bed, on the couch, or in a reclining chair.  Next time I travel, I'll probably bring something like [this](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1689432703/lapdeck-the-10-recyclable-laptop-desk) along.

## Keyboard / trackpad tray

Keyboard/trackpad can now sit in my lap comfortably.  Opens up a ton of body configurations, though I think to truly unlock its power you'd have to pair it with a nice monitor and monitor arm...

## Laptop stand

[this](http://www.amazon.com/Rolodex-82410-Laptop-Stand/dp/B000JE7CMG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1440712866&sr=8-3&keywords=laptop+stand) is the closest thing I could find to what I use ... not really pertinent for working from bed, but great when paired w/ keyboard and trackpad.
