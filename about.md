Hi, I'm Kyle, a web developer specializing in Ruby on Rails, JS/CoffeeScript and PostgreSQL.  I also have a few iOS apps [under my belt][1] (Swift), and one crappy [Android app][3] floating around.

JS wise, I have experience in jQuery, Backbone, Angular, a bit of Ember, Polymer (and thus Vanilla JS), and Node.js (mainly in tandem with Firebase).

My go-to DB is Postgres, but I also love Firebase, and think the two can actually complement each other nicely.

I'm very thankful for all of the awesome, open-source, free tools that others have built, and try to contribute back to OS where I can.

Outside of programming, I can be a bit of an information junky, constantly consuming various web articles/forums, podcasts, and books.  I'm working on toning that down, though.

Of of 9/25/16, I'm reading [Cat's Cradle][4] by [Kurt Vonnegut][6], and just finished [_The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_][5] -- I'm also working on that.
